# Agent-Based-Simulation-Model
### Agent Based Simulation Model Created for CASA Dissertation 

This model seeks to test the logistical viability of cargo e-bikes as a van replacement in high density urban areas at a micro level through an agent based model built in Pythonâ€™s Mesa library. In particular, the model simulates a single lane road where both vans and cargo bikes deliver parcels. This is important as there is growing concern about the impact vans have on cities both in terms of traffic and pollution.
